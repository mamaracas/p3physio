              As part of being a specialist it is important to recognise
              limitations and develop links with other professions. If following
              assessment and diagnosis it is felt that other professions can aid
              your recovery to complement physiotherapy then Neil has excellent
              links with orthopaedic surgeons around the local area along with
              links with pain specialist nurses and consultants who can be
              referred to if required. Neil also works with osteopaths and
              sports rehabilitators to provide a full individual service from
              injury to recovery and health.
